# Samsung shortcuts 

Some "apps" that just act as trampolines to other features that may be harder to access in Samsung's
One UI skin.

- Smart View (normally buried in either the Quick Settings pane or Settings)
- Voice Assistant (One UI 7 removed the navigation bar swipe gesture, and I have the power button remapped)
